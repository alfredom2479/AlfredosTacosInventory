# AlfredosTacosInventory

This is a basic inventory app made using Node.js (Express).

Users can make Categories, in which they can store Items, in which they can store Item Instances. Users can also modify and delete categories, items, and item instances.

Item instances have an "Arrival Date" and "Use-By Date" to differentiate between batches (instances) of the same item.
